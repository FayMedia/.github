<h3 align="center">ðŸ¤” About us... ðŸ¤”</h3>
<h5 align="center">
Hi, we are young Germans who are attending Danish high school. 
<br></br>
Our goal is to help other developers with our products by making their everyday life easier.
<br></br>
The whole thing is a non-profit project, which means that almost all our work is released to the public for free.
<br></br>
In our runtime as an organisation, we will mostly work with Java, except for specific other things.
<br></br>
All products uploaded here are largely planned and managed by PhilippG (https://github.com/daedalusdontknow).
<br></br>
In the future we plan to build a website that will have nice and cool features. 
<br></br>
Thank you for choosing Fay-Media!
